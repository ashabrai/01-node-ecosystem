#Node Ecosystem
- This assignment to create a simple test to see if my code works.

##Getting Started
- Fork repo 
- Clone repo into local device 
- Create a test folder
- Create a lib folder 
- In test folder, that's where you will have your test function for your .js file.
- In lib folder that's where you will have you .js file for the code itself. 

## Things you need to install
-npm init -y will create an package.json file 
-npm I -D jest you need to run this application 
 
## When you are ready to run test
-npm run test


##What to expect
-In the .js file, you'll see two functions. 
First function will be an addition. The second function you'll see will be a subtract. 
-For each function you will see a if statement that requires to return 
a error if what was given was not NaN.
-And if what was given was numbers, it'll continue with adding or subtracting. 
-In the .test.js file, you will two common test functions.
    *test : Which is a description of what its doing.
    *expect : Is return what it should be.
    
-*const: This will be what the function that your trying to test is actually doing.
